__label__0 "this jacket was too wide and the length in the arms too short . i wear a medium in almost any article of clothing and felt like i was swimming in a short little jacket . the ratio of how wide it is to the length is not for me but might work well with other body types . the arms were definitely too short ."
__label__0 "ditto to all of the reviews who state that this top is beautiful but runs small in the bust . i am a large or an xl so i ordered this in the xl . i 'm a little broad and busty and it was too small/binding . this is a beautiful well made top for a certain body type ."
__label__1 "great quality coat ! very pretty colors and love the sleeves ! i would have given 5 stars but like other reviewers stated this coat does she 'd . best not to wear black . it is a slight swing style coat so it 's not fitted at the waist and hips but very stylish . i found it best to size down . i 'm 5 ' 4 118lb but i 'm large chested ( 32dd ) i usually wear a size 6 coat or blazer so it fits my chest but the six was too big . the size 4 fit great across my chest and still room for a sweater !"

__label__0 "i tried this sweater on in the store . i wanted to love it so badly as it is soft and feminine and would be a great causal layering piece . however there are pockets in the sweater that are right on seam and they actually bubble out from the natural drape of the sweater . not to mention unless you 're built very narrow the pockets will fall at and accentuate hips and not in a flattering way . the nice details are the feel of the knit the layered style with a cottony lined hood and faux lay"
__label__0 "i saw this top on sale and tried it on right away . my normal medium was too big so i purchased the small in the rose color . wore it with a shimmery kimono and cream colored pilcro boyfriend jeans . wow what an outfit ! ! ! ! then i washed it according to directions and sadly it shrunk into a crop peplum tank . i was so disappointed . i wished i had read the reviews beforehand ."

__label__-1 "i really wanted to love this dress but i could n't . it ran large and heavy . rather than a sleek cocktail dress it felt more like a heavy sack once i put it on . there was one upside : the drape in the back did not appear to drop quite as low so finding a bra to wear under the dress might be easier than if it draped as low as it appears in the picture ."
__label__0 "i loved the design of these pants and got them to go with the matching jacket . the problem with them is there is n't enough stretch to keep them up . i found that thru out the day i was pulling them up as they would slide down . the pant fabric should have had more stretch or they should have put stronger elastic at the waist ."

__label__0 "i really wanted this to work . the style and colors are great and it is comfortable too . i did n't like how big the skirt portion was or how stiff the fabric was . it looked like a plaid tent on me but not in a terrible way . it could work on the right body ."
__label__0 "i have more of an athletic figure and the sleeves tend to come in closer to the body than pictured . i did n't like that cut on my arms/torso . the shirt is really cute otherwise ! i am usually a size 4/small and this was a little short and snug ."
__label__1 "this shirt is a very cute dressed up casual kind of top . the lace detail in the front and the back make a plain long sleeve black top look elegant . the material on the shirt is pretty light so it is for fall or spring ."
__label__-1 "good reason to read reviews . i concur with others in that it fins large and looks boxy . heavy fabric makes matters worse ."
__label__1 "this top is my new favorite . i ordered it on a whim and oh boy am i glad ! ! i was so excited for it to be shipped to me and once it arrived i could n't wait to put it . once i put it on i could n't wait to show it off ! it is such a great bluish-grayish color and looks great with some big hoop earrings shorts and sandals . such an easy classic simple shirt that i will probably wear too much ."

__label__0 "i was so excited for this coat when i saw it in the catalog but disappointed when it got to stores . the faux fur pictured both here and in the catalog looked much more of a burnt red brown color than the straight up maroon that it actually is in store . i 'd say it even looks a bit purple . the nice thing is that it is detachable and you can replace it with something else if you really do n't like the color . i have decided to buy it anyways because the fit of the coat is lovely and simply stunning ."
__label__0 "really wanted to love this especially with the lacing and long length for this off-the-shoulder top . when the top arrived the lacing was stiff and length of the straps were long so that the bottom of the lace did n't completely cover my black strapless bra ( and i felt it sat a bit too low down my chest ) . thought about taking in the straps but then the area around the armpits would be uncomfortable . i did love the length of the top though . wish this top was a keeper but going to have to return ."
__label__0 "i am all for a cute flowy tee but this one felt like i was swimming a bit . if you 're a true xs i 'd skip this one . however if you are able to size down i think it would look really great !"
__label__0 "the jacket was nice and soft but it was too short on my torso with a cropped fit which i 'm not a fan of that style . i returned it ."
__label__1 "another success ! so comfortable and stylish for spring and summer . very lightweight yet not sheer . design is even more appealing in person . a must have for your closet ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this top but when i received the picture on the website is a dark charcoal almost black and the grey that you order is much much lighter grey . in addition this shirt is super boxy ... thus why the model probably is pinning her elbows to her side to bring the top in . going back disappointed ."
__label__0 "this top did not look at all like it did on the model . i thought it would be slightly loose through the hips but instead it was snug on top and very very very loose . great for someone who is pregnant . which i am not . returning ."
__label__1 "perfect fit . this dress is super flattering the criss-crossing fabric at the bust looks awesome on . the fabric is a little bit thicker through there which is nice for coverage . the skirt is light and airy and the pattern is so pretty ! the perfect spring to summer dress !"
__label__0 "these sleep pants are very pretty soft and comfortable . unfortunately after washing them once i noticed some small holes in the fabric which is very disappointing considering the price . i do n't mind paying a little more for clothing if i feel like the quality is there but in this case i 'm not so sure . i guess if you do n't really sleep in them or wash them then they would probably be ok but then what 's the point of buying them ?"
__label__0 "as another reviewer mentioned the quality is n't here . they pilled in the thighs after wearing once and stretched out so much at the end of the day i was pulling them up constantly . such a bummer because i love this brand ."
__label__-1 "i like my dresses oversized but this one is ridiculous . it 's seriously unflattering . i usually between a m & a l and i got a small and it 's still massive . but the slip is tiny . it looks so cute in the picture . but not good in person ."

__label__0 "love the way this dress looks online . sadly it does n't look great on me . i 'm 5 ' 4 athletic build . the small fit perfectly but the extra fabric in the hip/pocket area just seemed to drag me down . i really wished this worked for me but i think you 've got ta be a little bit taller to pull this one off ."
__label__-1 "these are my all time comfiest shorts and i am obsessed with the lavender color . sadly using free and clear detergent on a cold delicate cycle made the color turn splotchy and they are unwearable . this happened once and i exchanged for another pair but i 'll be returning this pair . i 'll be sad to see my favorite color go but there is obviously a defect in the dye used . maybe i 'll try another color !"
__label__-1 "i 'm baffled why none of the other reviewers have mentioned how large these pants are . i ordered the petite small and i 'm always a small . these are huge . i felt like i had on a large . i like the thin material and color and i 'm sad that they are so large ."
__label__-1 "i 'm not sure why this dress is getting great reviews . the plunging neckline is ridiculous and ran down to the underwire of my bra and the slit up the side came up to the upper part of my thigh . it was one of the worst fitting/cut dresses i 've every tried on at retailer . i 'm 5 ' 4 125. maybe you have to be 6 feet tall and 90 pounds for this dress to not look like a bad renaissance faire costume ."
__label__-1 "so i really loved this dress . i am tall ( 6ft ) and the size 8 was perfect length . i would have worn it with flat dressy sandals . i would say it is true to size . i am not a flowy dress kind of girl but this was just the perfect amount of flow without making me feel like i was wearing a long potato sack . the back is just gorgeous and unique . here is why i could n't make it mine . the tube top part is completely detachable and extremely thin . there is literally not much to it and i 'm not sure it wou"

__label__-1 "i found this dress to be very short waisted much closer to an empire waist than shown in the picture . it was also an inch or two longer in the skirt than other maxi dresses i 've gotten from retailer . it really could have used those inches above the waist . just a strange fit overall ."
__label__-1 "this sweater is adorable and comfortable but the poms are barely secured so they just pop off whenever they rub up against anything . i can not even imagine trying to wash it . unfortunately i will reluctantly be returning it because the construction is very poor ."
__label__0 "this top was a disappointment for me . it was beautiful but because of the material it is made out of it will stretch out as you wear it and not regain it 's shape . it is also a little heavy for day time during summers in the south .... but the weight of it was not so much of a concern as the ability to retain its shape ."
__label__1 "when i received this dress i was surprised by the weight of the fabric . it 's not as light and gauzy as the photos appear and it is fully lined . it 's more substantial in a good way . also i had thought it would be more of a straight cut but it 's definitely a swing which i prefer . with the lining it does stand out a bit from your body so it 's not a clingy look at all . i like it a lot but i do n't think it fits the way you would expect from the photo . it 's roomy i could probably have sized down . i"

__label__-1 "after trying several sizes including petite and regular i am sad to return this dress . the regular sizes were too long on me ( i am 5 ' 4 ) and although the petite fit me just a little short the biggest issue was how tent like it fit me . i wanted it to look like it does on the model but i just could n't get the fit . usually i have great luck with cloth & stone ."
__label__0 "i like design of the dress softness and color ( i got grey ) the dress is shorter on me then on model ( 5 ' 6 145 lbs ) i got m fits ok but i do n't like fabric quality it seems like it can be peeled and picks up everything and needs to be sprayed all the time . despite i got it with 40 % discount it will come back as it 's poor quality ."
__label__-1 "the fabric of this top is lovely . the fit not so . it does not fit as shown on the model . the fit is very large around the middle and fits more like a swing top . i am 5 ' 9 slim build . i ordered my usual size medium . shoulders and back fit perfectly . too much material around the middle . had it had a straight cut to it as shown i 'd keep it . because it does n't it 's going back ."
__label__0 "well this top just did not do anything for me - it 's a very conservative style with the high neckline and blousy fit . you 'd need to go a little lower in size if you want any of your figure to show through . i guess it might be good for a church function or some other conservative event but it was too buttoned-up for my style . i also had a hard time getting it off even though the size i tried on was large for me . i did n't care for the feel of the fabric either although the lace is nice ."
__label__0 "i thought this was so cute online sweet and feminine but when it arrived and i tried it on in my usual 12p i felt like i had just stepped back into freshman year of highschool - it is very early 90s - not the bohemian i was going for . it is also very high waisted even for my little 5 ' 1 frame . i truly felt like they pulled this out of someone 's closet dusted it off and said ta da ! as much as i love rachel and monica i have moved on from their clothing : )"

__label__1 "i can not say enough good things about this dress . as a petite person ( 5 ' 0 ) it is so hard to find things that fit well without alterations but this dress fit perfectly . it 's also so well-made : the fabric is soft comfortable and gorgeously detailed and the dress is lined which makes it feel durable and gives the skirt some volume ( in a good flattering way ) ! i got it shortened by about 2 but this dress fits like a dream ."
__label__-1 "this jacket looked adorable on . it was also quite comfortable . however it sheds and left fuzz on every dark surface it touched . sadly this is a deal breaker for me ."
__label__0 "i tried this on in my usual size and it was tight through the chest because of the lining . i would have preferred to wear a cami beneath and then it may have worked . the color and pattern are gorgeous the fabric feels a bit weird kind of dry and rough ? would have liked to see this in a longer length and more tapered . it is an absolute pregnant top . so sad its so pretty !"
__label__1 "i am pleased with this skirt . the jean material is of good quality and it hangs right on my waist and hips . i ordered a 2 which left a little room in the waist to tuck in a blouse . i am 5/5 and 119. it works well for work and leisure ."
__label__1 "i thought these were pretty on the website but in person they look like a work of art ! the colors are vivid -- bright reds pinks greens blues yellow -- with flora fauna houses writing type and so many other things on a white and cream background . they are very soft medium-weight flannel . for me they run true to size . i wish they had pockets though !"
__label__0 "i ordered the petite in my size since i 'm well petite but curvy . i recommend this dress if you do n't have a lot of boobage . unfortunately for me the waist line came up high an inch below my bra line and made the dress poof out at my hips in an unflattering way . its so pretty and i was really excited about ordering it . it fits but just is not flattering because of my boobs . this is always my problem though with dresses ."
__label__0 "i agree with the other reviewer who stated this sweater is very 80 's ! ! online it looks minorly fluffy with muted colors but in person it 's a bad overly-fuzzy christmas sweater with super bright 80 's colors ! ! if you 're going for kitschy / tacky / retro this may work for you but if you are looking for the sweater in the photo you 'll be disappointed ... : ( it looked to be true to size but to be honest i hated it so much i did n't even try it on ."
__label__-1 "i though this dress would be similar to the turtleneck swing dress by maeve . it 's not . first of all it runs very large . i purchased a small ( i am usually a xs or small in maeve i purchased a small in the turtleneck swing dress ) . the shoulders were very wide you had to manually cross the fabric around your neck but it did n't lay as flat as what i wanted around my chest and it was quite large around my rib cage and stomach making it rather shapeless . i really wanted this dress to work ( i love"
__label__1 "this dress is so much better in person ! i got the petite size ( i am 5 ' 2 ) and it seems to run a bit smaller than the regular size- i have a fairly large bust so i went up a size and it seems to fit perfectly . love the colors and vintage design ! i ca n't wait to wear it for a wedding i will be attending !"
__label__0 "i fell in love with this trench when i first saw it online but ended up returning it once i tried it on . i 'm 5 ' 9 140 lbs and the m fit true to size . but the belt hit above my natural waistline and the skirt of the coat was much fuller than i expected making me look heavier . the material also wrinkles easily and the stitching was poor quality with lots of loose threads . disappointed as the color and concept were great ."
__label__-1 "and this one proved to be no different . the short end of it ; this dress is pretty much super thick heavy linen with a rope like collar ( the supposed embroidery you see ) and there is no lining but completely unnecessary pockets . i 'm typically a 2 or 4 depending on the designer ( 5 ' 7 & a super fit 135 lbs ) and knew enough to order an xs in this however it still fit like a potato sack . even upon taking it out of the plastic bag i knew it was going back . between the unrealistic pictures and lack"
__label__1 "i picked this dress up to take into the dressing room to try on without looking at the price tag . im typically a small and he dress in store was an xs but because of the wrap i figured i 'd try it anyway . this dress is to die for ! the xs fit me just fine ( though the snap at the chest would n't stay closed but i thought it looked ok ) . i looked at the tag after falling in love with the dress but left the store without it . i 'm contemplating purchasing it still because i ca n't stop thinking about it ! !"
__label__-1 "i love this dress but i will return it because the sleeves are too tight . i have never had this problem before . i ordered a petite 0 and petite 2. for reference i am 5 ' 4 tall and 117 lbs . the length is perfect and i really like the style . if the sleeves had not been so tight i would have kept the petite 0. the petite 2 sleeves were no looser . sorry that this did not work for me ."
__label__0 "this sweatshirt is very comfortable and the length of the sleeves is very generous ! the bodice is short so you may have to wear a camisole or tank top to avoid exposing your tummy . i usually purchase medium sized tops but had to return for an xl ! this runs very small ."

__label__1 "i wanted to love this top . unfortunately the color & fit did n't work for me . i 'm a 36ddd . the fit was ok it even flattered my bust i just felt the stripes did n't flatter my waist . this would be perfect for an athletic frame ."
__label__1 "but tight around the chest i ordered xs petite after trying on xxs petite and both are a tad tight on the chest area kept xs petites as bigger would be too much fabric everywhere else . green color is classic and the back is longer than the front . overall flattering if with the right outfit . i 'm 30 dd and 115 lbs for reference ."

__label__0 "i was very excited to try out this dress . i 've been looking for a velvet dress for a couple of years now and .. i 'm not digging this one . the fabric itself was a let down right off the bat . it 's cheap looking to me . i 've seen nice velvet and this is very shiny thin and slightly sheer ! the dress cut itself is what i was expecting a loose baby doll type dress . the length hit above my knees . the overall effect made me feel very gypsy-ish ... my husband gave a firm no ! when he saw me walk out of"

__label__0 "soft cozy and cute but pilled badly after 1st wearing and now will be relegated to wearing at home only . for this reason i can not recommend . felt like i wasted my money . i purchased the xs petite ( i 'm 5 ' 1 . 95 lbs ) and i could have gone down to xxs but i was ok with it being looser ."
__label__-1 "how cute was this little sweater and comfortable even in the south .... until i washed it ! i followed the instructions on the label being careful not to wring it out . first of all the smell was unbelievable ! i washed it three days ago and it is still wet and damp and on top of that it shrunk . even though i handwashed it line dried it and pampered it to no end !"
__label__0 "this style of shirtdress usually fits me perfectly however this did not fit me one bit . the waist was too large the length too short and the hips too small . i was really hoping this would fit since it 's a unique color and the material is substantial but soft . i will be returning this ."
__label__-1 "bought this cami/tank on sale which i 'm glad but it has a flap underneath like a bralette but not fitted .. it kinda just drapes under the cami ... the problem is it 's not thick enough to offer the coverage you would want under a white tank ... but it was also too short so it caused a visible line underneath that showed through.that was higher than the bottom of my chest .. so it gave the appearance that i wore the wrong bra/undergarment ... it simply looks awkward ... not sure if it would 've been better"
__label__0 "while there is nothing wrong with this top it did n't really have an retailer feel . it looked more like something from a dept store maybe a boutique . i got on sale but sending back bc i just do n't like it that much especially next to my pale skin . i could see it looking much better in someone with darker skin tone . i 'm usually a 8/10 med . small in this top fit well ."
__label__1 "the fabric is very light weight more of a shirting material . this surprised me because the dark flowers almost looked like flocked velvet in the picture . the flowers are actually printed on cotton that has woven stripes . it is so soft and light ! there is also a little webbing detail in the front yoke but nothing shows because there is a simple sewn in lining . the skirt is not lined but the hem is weighted with a trim so that the skirt will hang right . very flattering . it does run big tho"
__label__0 "this dress is so cute and so flattering . i loved the shape but i wore it wonce and the fabric was pulling on everything ! just holding a purse while walking managed to pull out a ton of the fabric ! when you spend so much money on something you think the quality would be better .."

__label__-1 "awful color horribly wrinkled and just a mess ... so disappointed"
__label__-1 "i agree with the previous reviewer that the fabric and details are beautiful but with the shirring from the neckline and absolutely no fitting anywhere my shape got totally lost and i looked huge . the difference in length of the dress and slip really bothered me as well . possibly great for pregnancy because you look like your about 8 1/2 months anyway ."

__label__-1 "the bottom part of this romper is easy to put on but the top is very poorly designed . it needs a zipper at the side or less of a yoke along the back . you have to wrangle your limbs in somehow and i was afraid it might tear . once i got it on it fit perfectly though . getting out of it was a disaster . i had to ask a saleswoman for help and was so afraid it might rip . overall i was crushed that it did n't work out because the print is super cute and it is very flattering ."
__label__1 "bought these over the weekend and i am in love ! they are very soft extremely flattering and the rich green color is fantastic . i may go back for the black . i went with my usual size 28 for reference and the fit is great . these will be a fall staple for sure !"
__label__-1 "sadly this has to go back . i am 5 ' 5 128 lbs and this shirt is super short on me . very short . and it 's so wide it 's almost a trapeze cut . the overall effect is 50s/60s style maternity shirt . which is disappointing because the fabric is beautiful the detail is nice in person even the sleeve cuffs are great . i am not very tall and i 'm fairly thin on top so i can get away with a lot of styles loose and tight . the combo of short and trapeze is just unflattering ."
__label__-1 "was very surprised when i opened the package this dress is very thin fabric and you need to wear a half slip as it is see through . the top of the dress is short to the draw string and does not drape bloused style at all . i have a short waist length so it should have worked . the color is a little darker than pictured but over all looks cheap so full price with tax makes it way over priced . going back asap ."
__label__1 "what a special skirt . so beautiful great quality . i got on sale but still expensive . . and it was still worth it . i will be wearing this for years !"
__label__1 "if you love the boho style then this too is for you . it is very pretty and pairs well with skinny jeans leggings sandals boots and booties . i bought it in the orange color which is more of a burnt orange which is perfect for fall . it does run big which is the style so you could size down and still have room to hide flaws . for reference i 'm 5 ' 3 and bought the pm but needed the ps . i have recievied tons of compliments and i 'm thinking of getting the silver one too !"

__label__1 "i ordered these in the pinkish color and i love them ! i 'm 5 ' 8 140 lbs . and the size small fits perfectly . they are definitely sheer but they 're advertised as a cover-up so that was expected . these will be super cute paired with a bathing suit top - bikini bandeau or even tankini . the price is great especially for the type of pant and detailing with the pom poms . no pockets is the only negative ."
__label__0 "i was confused by this dress . the heavy fabric made me think of winter but the cut and print are springy . it 's also not lined and the material is not exactly soft . i put it back . cute but missed the mark ."
__label__0 "this dress is so pretty in the photos but in person it 's huge . and not in a way i could adjust by sizing down . the shoulders and arms fit but the body of the dress is absolutely huge . i normally love a trapeze dress but i was swimming in this so it was quite unflattering . it was also much longer than it looks on the model . i 'm not short - in fact dresses are normally a bit shorter on me than the average person but this was just frumpy ."
__label__0 "i 'm 5 ' 7 125lbs and the small fits perfectly . the sleeves are the right length ( i have long arms and legs ) and the body fits loosely without looking sloppy . at my height the small is not long enough to wear as a tunic which is fine . unfortunately the shirt arrived with makeup stains around the laces and the inside of the shirt so i had to wash it before wearing it . i only purchased this shirt because it was on sale ."
__label__1 "first i noticed that the grey was more like a blue-grey/navy which i do n't mind because it 's still a nice unique color . i ordered petite size 26 and although these are very well made/sturdy cords and fit at the ankle like the model pictured the thigh/calves were surprisingly a bit too tight for me ( and my calves are s c r a w n y ) . this cord version does n't seem as stretchy as some of their other styles so i 'm going back for the standard 26 's !"

__label__-1 "i really wanted to love the shorts . when i read that the shorts were lined i expected them to be lined so that my underwear did n't show . even though the shorts are lined you can see through the fabric completely . this was absolutely disappointing since the shorts have a lovely exterior design ; pockets ; and comfortable waistline . i 'm returning the shorts as well ."

__label__0 "i love the style of this dress but unfortunately it runs very small . i normally wear a size 8. i ordered a 10 and the dress was closer to a size 6. disappointed that i had to return it . also the seams were poorly done and threads hung out everywhere on the hem ."

__label__0 "this sweater is beautiful especially in the bordeaux color . the cable knit in varying directions makes it interesting and unique and the length is great for us short waisted ladies . my big issue with this sweater is the sleeves . there really are no sleeves just arm holes at the same level as the hem of the sweater so you feel as if you need to keep your arms pinned to your sides to keep from lifting the sweater up to expose your midsection or pushing the sleeves way up which then results in"

__label__-1 "this one will be going back . the color is really blah and the fabric was n't a texture i was expecting -- it is kind of thick and ribbed and i suspect it would stretch out over the course of the day . overall the cut and style is cute but i just felt like i was wearing a hospital gown with the combination of the fabric and the style . this may have been cute in a more vibrant color and lighter weight fabric ."

__label__1 "unlike other reviews i find this top to run true to size . for reference i 'm 5 ' 3 117 lbs 34 b cup and took an xs . top fits comfortably no tightness around the chest and sleeves ' fullness is n't overwhelming . the lace is see through so a cami is a must . top is of excellent quality and craftsmanship . i have not laundered it yet so i ca n't comment on that . so happy with my purchase ! a keeper for sure ! !"

__label__0 "i only gave this three stars due more to personal preference than to any real flaws with the product . it is very comfortable and for a jersey-style shirt quite warm . but that is one of my issues with the shirt . i wanted to wear it well into spring and i think it 'll be just too warm . ( i live in the northeast ) i also felt that while it fit tts it had a more generous fit than what i expected which was another negative for me . i wanted it to be more fitted to my body . however i did keep it because"
__label__1 "prior reviewer nailed it with the summary of this dress . it definitely needs heels . i 'm 5 ' 4 120 # 34d and this is a size 36. i usually wear a size s or 4 with most retailer stuff ."
__label__-1 "this looked nothing like the picture on me . was long and very unflattering . belled out greatly at the bottom also . the material was thick which is why i give it three starts for quality . but overall awkward ."
__label__-1 "buttons were broken off when i opened the package stretchy at waist not good quality for the price ."
__label__1 "i ordered this in the lavender and love the rich color ! looks great with my blonde hair . the bell sleeves which are all the rage right now add to the feminine look . i wore it with jeans and espadrilles for a fab boho look !"
__label__0 "this brand has odd fitting of late . i normally wear a m in retailer tops but i had to size up to 12 on this shirt as it was tight across my chest . i am a b cup and had a sports bra on when i tried it . brought it home and tried on with a regular non pushup bra and it pulls slightly . i might return it because my guess is that it will shrink when washed . otherwise its a cute tunic style top ."
__label__1 "love love love this top . it is everything i hoped it would be . i liked that it could be worn up or off the shoulder . what made me fall in love were the colors . quality is excellent as usual . it is quite full in bodice however it 's only an xs . i do best with xxs tops ."
__label__1 "i am 5 ' 1 '' and most normal size retailer tops are too big on the armpits and neckline for me . i do n't usually go for peplum but i was drawn to this top bc it was very soft . when i tried it on everything fit just perfect and length was also right for me . i like slight stretch of this fabric which hugs body nicely . i would say you should get a size that fits nicely on chest area ."
__label__-1 "quality piece except the fit is way off . i have a 32 c bust and long narrow torso larger on the bottom . i ordered the small . i frequently wear a small/extra small on top and i was busting out of this in the chest area . however the fit then flares way out from the torso and it just looked dumpy and overpowered my 6 foot frame . i marked it as running small which it does on top but then it runs very large on bottom . wanted it to work but did n't ."

__label__1 "i ? m mad for plaid but usually for smaller pattern and winter colors . somehow this top was love at first sight . it looks simple but it ? s not . it ? s unique in its own way ( look at the back the slightly puffy sleeves the side slit ) and the colors are such a great mix that go with everything . the stylist opened up a couple of side buttons and tied the material to a knot so cute . i purchased the xs and the fit is the same as shown online ( i ? m 5 ? 2 ? 34b 26 waist 36 hips ) . i know the price seems"
__label__0 "i wanted to love this top ! on me it was weirdly boxy . it was too wide and too short and it was more sheer than i expected it . the fabric is lightweight but wrinkles really easy and loses shape pretty quickly . i also thought the fabric would be heavier and have more structure than it has . i love the scalloped detail at the arms but after about five minutes of wear this felt super crumpled and just kind of sloppy . unfortunately it will be going back ."
__label__-1 "i was really looking forward to this dress . i tried it on and it does not wow like the picture . it came wrinkled but i think even pressed it would fall weird . the side swoop falls funny and you can see the seams underneath . and the top front falls funny not quite sure what to do with it . it almost looks like a mock turtleneck until you fold it down . again maybe if you get it pressed that would be better . the back is still beautiful though . i 'm 5 ' 3 115lbs ordered a 0. maybe on someone talle"
__label__1 "i found this to be true to size ( m fit me well - 5 ' 7 140 lb usually a size m for tops ) . it does have a straight fit and it hits at the waist . i would n't call it cropped but if you prefer longer tops you may want to layer . it looks cute with a collared shirt underneath and you can pull the shirt 's cuffs over the sweatshirt . the sleeves were a great length ."
__label__0 "the quality and color is great on this top . the neckline just seemed a be pulled a little too tight on the one side of my neck to be a true off-the -shoulder look . and to wear it as a cowl neck ( or actually looks like a boat neck ) just makes it too ordinary- since i love the off the shoulder look . it fit me everywhere else and the slim waistline of this top is super flattering- so i think my size was right . the cut of the neckline just needed to be more more definitive one way or the other ."
__label__1 "this dress fits beautifully . it is warm and comfortable . winter 's gem ."
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this dress . the cut fit and color are adorable . unfortunately the fabric is super thin . due to the material type it can be clingy in a manner that requires the anti-static spray your mom used to use in the 80s . i was on the fence of keeping it but if there is so much as a wrinkle in your panty-line the whole world will see it . i would hate to have to wear a slip with this due to static issue . i am most likely going to return it ; even at 15 % off it is over-priced for the cheap"
__label__0 "i love vintage lace so i was very excited to try on this dress . unfortunately it just did n't work for me . i 'm a larger busty lady ( size 14 ) and i tried on the xl . it fit fine but did absolutely nothing for my figure . it just kind of hung on me . even with the belt tie i still feel like it did n't accentuate my waist line . i think this is better for someone with a straighter figure ."

__label__1 "i ca n't wait for our warmer weather to arrive here in minnesota so i can wear this lovely tank top . the style is so flattering it does n't bag out to make you look pregnant . the back yoke is solid navy blue chiffon which is a nice touch . soft fabric drapes beautifully . the armholes are not oversized . the fabric is opaque so no camisole required . i am 5 ' 5 and 120 lbs . and 36a . i purchased size small ."
__label__0 "nicely made pretty details but it 's cropped fairly short and is rather boxy . wore with orange linen pants and it was cute !"

__label__-1 "loved this dress online but my small pettie stature made me looks like an orphan from the prairie ."
__label__-1 "i 've never had a problem with pilcro jeans . i own several pairs . however i ordered my regular size 28 ( i 'm 5 ' 3 120 pounds ) and not only were these jeans thin they had zero stretch and after 1 hour of wear stretched out horribly . they fit really loose and hung around my knees and legs which is very disappointing for a skinny jean ."
__label__0 "i really wanted this top to work but i felt that it was big and boxy . it 's shorter in the front and longer in the back . the seam and peplum hit at a strange place and made me look disheveled . it 's definitely worth trying on but did n't fit me ."
__label__-1 "i would have kept this dress if it were n't for the giant arm holes and reveal my entire bra on both sides . other than that it looks just like it does on the model and is a nice substantial material ."
__label__-1 "i am 5 ' 5 and 119 pounds with an athletic cury body type . the dress wore bulky and ran large at size 2 ."
__label__-1 "i was so excited to get this in the mail and so disappointed when i put it on . it had a nice feel to it and fit well when i zipped it up but i do n't really know how to adequately describe what it looked like when i glanced in the mirror - lumpiness along the seams ? i do n't know if it was a manufacturing flaw or not but it gave me lumpy-looking hips and then kind of clung around my mid-thigh area . returned it the next day ."
__label__1 "this is a beautiful well made jacket . also it 's very cozy and warm . unfortunately for me it was too short and wide . i ordered the petite but it was still too wide which also made it look too short . not flattering for my small frame ."
__label__1 "this sweater is a perfect transition piece ! the material is really soft . while it has the shape of a poncho it is cut nicely and does n't make you look like a big blob ."
__label__-1 "love the silhouette and coziness of the fabric . for the first few wearings i was in love . then it began to pill horribly . . . would not recommend . my mother said that 's going to pill up . and i ignored her . and she was right ."

__label__-1 "what a shame this dress is . i wear xl and am 5 ' 2 but the dress in the store in the size xs ( ! ! ! ! ! ) looked just the right size . yup ! xs was just the right size . i ca n't imagine anyone who wears m or s finding this dress fit flattering . it would look like a sack . it is an inch or two too short in the front for me so i 'll be returning it ."
__label__1 "love this tee purchased the blue and white i usually wear xs in many retailer items but opted for a medium in this tee so it would fit loose . works good not fitting too tight . i like it because it 's a tee shirt but it 's a little dressy great for going out to dinner etc ..."
__label__0 "this dress is stunning . it is a great classic that i wished had worked out for me . i went through 3 different dresses and each time the cap sleeve would tear . there is not much room if at any for arm movement without the fabric tearing . i am so disappointed . it wasn ' even tearing on a seam ( so there was no way to repair it ) . if you do not intent to dance in this dress and are wearing it for a low key night or dinner it would most likely work .... it is not for a wedding with dancing !"
__label__-1 "comments . the detail is lovely - especially the dragonflies on the sleeve . and the quality is there with the lining . trouble is this is thick fabric cut in a box shape . imo you have to be very skinny to pull this off and not look like a tank . i looked at the model ( after purchasing ) and notice that she has it open and swept back a bit bc if it is not it is terribly unflattering ."

__label__1 "i really like how this fits . it is soft and the eyelet details are very cute ."
__label__1 "i love this shirt ! red + navy is one of my fave color combos and the vintage feel is fantastic . the fabric is a little thicker and more sweater-like than i was expecting but it 's a good thing . the top is n't heavy but the knit gives it more texture & interest . this is the perfect thing to throw on for a casual sexy look ... covered but form-fitting and flattering ."
__label__-1 "i loved the color and design of this dress but needed to return it because it fit so poorly . the arm holes are entirely too big -- so big that alternations could n't fix it . maybe it 's because i am petite but i think it may be a design flaw ."

__label__1 "great light weight sweater . perfect for spring . runs true to size . definitely will buy another color ."
__label__1 "i saw this sweater and just about died . i loved the accentuated shoulders and beautiful knit detail on the sleeves . lucky for me retailer day started a couple of days after this sweater debuted and i snagged it right away . i just got it and am in love . it fits true to size and the shoulders and sleeves are everything i hoped they would be . the neckline in very flattering as well . it is soft and the color is gorgeous . if there is a negative it would be that it is a bit boxy in the torso and doe"
__label__-1 "the dresss is much shorter than described . very see thru though guess you can tell from picture . expected more for the price ."
__label__0 "those pants sit pretty snug on top and get very wide very fast . this looks odd in my opinion if you do not wear a tunic style top like on the picture . also the material is quite thin which makes the snug part look unflattering . they were not for me unfortunately ."
__label__1 "i am always looking for a shirt that 's a little different yet as comfortable as a normal t-shirt ( running after a 1 year old i need comfort ) . i bought two colors and love the vibrant pink/salmon and the dark purple ( which i think it said was blue for some reason ) . the material is nice and the cut is feminine ."
__label__-1 "i was so excited about this top and so disappointed when it arrived today . the lace part is lovely but the skirt part is a crinoline type fabric that balloons out at the sides . it is gathered at the sides rather than pleated and there is no way to get it to lay flat . the back center section is pleated . why could n't they have had the pleats all around ? this will be going back with much regret ."
__label__0 "love the idea of this but it ran short and boxier than i would have liked . material is soft cute design but not flattering . returning"
__label__0 "the green color was beautiful but the top was too low cut and looked more maternity than boho ."
__label__0 "this was very tight in the bust in my typical size . it fit more or less everywhere else but the material has no give . so unless you are the precise measurements of the dress this will be a hard dress to wear . the color is really lovely though !"
__label__0 "material is very thin and although this is apparent in the design i just did n't like the way the cuffed sleeves felt ..."
__label__1 "i wanted to comment about the wash. yes these jeans look really ? dirty ? when you pull them out of the package . but after a few months of washing the dirty color has really mellowed . also i am a usual 26 in jeans purchased these in 25 and could have fit into the 24. i may purchase another pair these jeans are really unique comfortable great for the summer with sandals or converse ."
__label__-1 "these run at least 2 sizes smaller than other styles of the same brand mother . such a bummer because the quality is totally on point . i 'm going to exchange them for a huge size i guess . whatever i do n't mind having a size that 's so much larger than all my other jeans . i just mind the complete hassle of the exchange process . i wish mother would get their sizing issues under control . it 's not retailer 's fault . so annoyed ."
__label__0 "i love the front of this shirt but i really should have paid more attention to the details of it . i would have realized the front and back are different materials which i am not a fan of . i would have preferred the entire thing was made of the dressier front material instead of the jersey back . it 's like a mullet business in the front and party in the back . it 's got great drape and is a beautiful blue though so into rotation it goes ."
__label__0 "i bought this a few weeks back . when i saw it ( the blue one ) in the store i touched it and it was extremely soft and even plush like . i tried it on and found it odd that this cloth and stone garment like other viewers stated fit my bust and hips typically they do n't . i love the side buttons . i wear mine opened half way . my only complaint is i 've washed it like the instructions state and my blouse is no longer as soft as it was before and it needs to be ironed as it wrinkles easily . i still li"

__label__0 "great looking shirt that i bought for my wife but poor quality . the fit is great but the buttons literally keep falling off . first time my wife wore it two buttons just fell off . when she was sewing them back on she showed me and another button just came off with the slightest tug . its really too bad because it looks great otherwise ."
__label__-1 "this dress looks so cute in the pictures-i love the style . ordered typical size and it was huge-felt like many sizes too big ."
__label__0 "relaxed fit soft and comfortable . interesting design but material is extremely thin . if i had purchased this at full price i probably would have returned it . it seems more like a pajama top ..."
__label__-1 "this skirt looks and feels cheap and the color is much more green than pictured . additionally i comfortably wore a size 4 and then lost a few pounds and this is still way too tight to be flattering ."
__label__1 "for once i found a peasant top that was n't a balloon . i 'm 5 ' 1 and curvier on top and the small fit great . the blouse billowed a bit but it did n't make me look like a hot air balloon . the pattern of the blouse a mix of various floral swatches is very pretty . the blouse will look great with black skinny jeans and boots for fall . i ca n't wait to wear it !"
__label__0 "these are the very stretchy almost spongy type fabric . i ordered my usual size and they fit me like a sausage skin . crazy small ! ! !"
__label__0 "so bummed ... i ordered this in the raspberry color then actually saw it in a store before it arrived to my house so i tried it on . while i agree with the other reviews it runs big in some areas something about the neckline just was n't right on me . it seemed to ride up higher and was n't what i wanted . also the raspberry color is almost more of a burnt orange . when i think of raspberry i think of pink or red this was neither of those . the top itself is cute though and super comfy . if it we"
__label__0 "i love the design of this sweater and ordered it online but was disappointed with the quality of the yarn when it arrived . also the color was a little different than i expected from the photo still a type of ivory but a little yellow-y . the sweater was solid looking but the yarn seemed a bit cheap and i 'm not sure how well it would have worn over time . flattering cut . i liked how it fit but for the price and fabric i decided to return it . unfortunate to lose money on shipping ."

__label__0 "i love these pants -- bought them in the mustard color . my only complaint is that they are not colorfast -- i washed them in cold water with other colored items -- most of which belonged to my husband . not good -- and pretty much ruined an entire load of laundry except for these pants . retailer -- please color test your garments . there is really no excuse for fabrics like this to run in this day and age !"
__label__-1 "i ordered the shirt bc it looked soo cute despite the fact many said this shirt was see thru . it 's true .. had to return it"
__label__-1 "the top is more of a cream color than an ivory . it 's also a bit boxer than anticipated . fit is true to size ."
__label__-1 "i am 5 ' 4 120lbs got xs . it was huge on me . had to return it . very trendy great quality unfortunate design . not worth the money ."
__label__0 "lovely jeans love the details in the cuff bottoms . the front of the jeans the relaxed boyfriend part was just too relaxed for me - too much material there that it was unflattering . otherwise cute ."
__label__-1 "i love this tank it is so comfortable but it does have its flaws . it rolls up every time i walk or do anything it becomes very bothersome ."
__label__0 "ordered this online in the pinkish color . the material is a little thin . as a busty curvy lady this one just did n't sit right ran a tad large and looked boxy . if you have a thinner frame may be a better look for you . detailing is nice ."
__label__0 "this top is adorable and has a looser fit ( as shown on the model shot ) so i would have liked to size down ; however the arms are extremely fitted/tight and there 's no way i could have fit my arms into the next size down . if you have slim arms maybe you could size down and make this work ."
__label__0 "this blouse is gorgeous but as other reviewers have noted it runs small and it 's very thin . the back is see-through not the front though if you tend to wear things a little large and order up a size the back is fine . my real issue is that it shrank so much when i washed it ( on cold delicate cycle hang dry ) that it 's pretty much unwearable now . sad ."
__label__1 "i absolutely love this dress . it is super soft and flattering for my body type ( petite and curvy ) . though i wish it did come in petite as the upper body part of the dress would fit a little better . but that did n't stop me from purchasing as that 's an easy alteration . very flattering . love it ."
__label__-1 "it 's a rather boring tank . i thought it 'd be perfect under a cardigan for work but decided against it . the fit is boxy and does not look good on a girl with curves ."
__label__1 "love this top ! i typically wear a 4-6 and went with the 6 on this one . the length was better and the the buttons were perfectly closed . i am a 34d . this top looks great with everything ."
__label__0 "according to the sizing chart i should be an 8 or 10. i ordered a 10 but i could not get the blouse zipped up around the ribcage the one spot i do n't keep any fat . i brought it to the store to exchange for a 12 but i could n't breath with the 12 on . for reference i am 34ddd . it was the 34 part that did n't fit the ddd would have fit fine i think ."
__label__0 "just a warning the yoke on this dress has sequins underneath . i 'm not a sparkle kinda gal so as soon as i saw that the dress went right back in the package and will be going back to the store . i wish that had been described or more evident in the pictures to me it cheapens the whole dress which would otherwise be adorable ."
__label__0 "i loved the lavender color on the cape . it was soft and comfortable . but the design on the front ruined it for me . it took me all of 1 minute to know it was going back . it looked like florescent bird feathers nothing wrong with that it just was n't my style at all . i was a bit disappointed as it would have been perfect for cool ca nights . it looked more subdued in the photo it 's not . i clicked i would recommend to others as it is nicely made and i guess just not my taste as far as the colors an"
__label__1 "i absolutely love this sweater . it 's super soft and the grey/white version is lovely . it 's definitely more cropped ( i 'm 5 ' 7 ) but looks great with high waisted jeans or a pencil skirt . so cozy !"
__label__1 "love the fit and color but the material is my favorite . it 's so soft and comfy . feels like your walking around in your pjs !"
__label__-1 "i loved this t-shirt when i first tried it on : a good cut -- not too drapey or fitted . but then i washed it ( laid flat to dry ) and it shrunk so much that it 's unwearable now . so disappointing ."
__label__1 "anytime i see this brand at retailer in a button down i have to buy it . fit is always so flattering comfy and the prints are always great !"
__label__1 "i really love these leggings . the different textures that all the colors have make them interesting . quality is great . i am 5 1 and 125lbs . the s/m fit pretty well but i wish there was a xs option . but still would not hesitate to buy again ! ! i actually went to retailer tonight to purchase all the other colors ... that 's how happy i am with this purchase !"
__label__0 "a nice comfy sweatshirt . i do wish it was just a tad longer ; tends to run a little short and therefore looks a little boxy and i 'm only 5 ' 3 ! ( i purchased the regular size not the petite ) also the front wool insert is a little scratchy as it is not lined on the inside ."
__label__-1 "it 's a cute top but once i washed in cold water and laid flat to dry it shrunk and lost it 's shape . very disappointed . i am going to return top ."
__label__0 "i love the rich deep color and the style but once again this brand runs really small in the waist . i am normally a 8/10 in retailer skirts and the size 10 was tight at the waist enough so i could not button it and feel comfortable . the quality is ok something i feel i would see at another type of discount store . for me this skirt did not work but the color and softness of the fabric was a plus ."
__label__-1 "first it 's huge . i 'm not big busted but it 's so roomy that i looked like i was pregnant . not exactly what i was going for . nice color and soft fabric but would only work if you plan to tuck it in -- and i 'm short waisted so no tucking for me . back it went ."
__label__-1 "the model must have this sweater pinned at the back . the sweater color is true and the material soft as anything but the fit is ? ? ! ! at 5 ' 9 with a long torso and broad shoulders the large was still shlumpy . did n't hang right at all bunches oddly and is not the least bit flattering . my 5 ' 7 uber fit daughter had the same issue and she usually makes everything that does n't work for me look amazing . returned ."
__label__0 "it was ok. very swingy and lots of fabric at the bottom . the pocket seemed to not sit in the right spot like it was too far over and i wanted to keep adjusting the position of the shirt . i might buy it on sale but i sent it back bc it 's definitely not worth $ 60 ."
__label__0 "was excited for this shirt . i usually wear a medium to large depending on the cut and material so i went with a medium . i was swimming in it . definitely recommend ordering a size below your normal ."
__label__-1 "agree with above review . these are described totally wrong . they are not 8.5 rise . they are very high rise so much that i didnt even try them on ... the color isnt good either it looks like a cheap levi 's color or just not a quality denim . if you like high rise you might like them . i ca n't comment on fit .."
__label__-1 "i tried this shirt in the purple motif it fit true to size my normal small worked well . all was good on the front turned around to admire the slight detail of the neckline in the back and all i could see with the red thread the designer used to sew their tag in . really ? on a white shirt ? it annoyed me so much i did n't buy the shirt ."
__label__0 "this dress is such a crazy beautiful color the picture does n't do it justice . i ordered this right when i saw it and i almost love it . the color is very bright and the fabric seems nice but i just did n't find it flattering at all . the slip was n't the nicest but completely not a deal breaker . i did n't think it was overly flattering on the model either so i was hoping by some miracle that i would like it anyway but something about the way it 's cut is just a little off for me . it was very tru"
__label__1 "i love this top . very comfortable fabric and it can be worn in multiple ways . it is tight on the bottom . i usually wear an xs ( 5 ' 4 and 120 lbs ) . had to exchange for a small . very flattering . liked it so much i ordered it in both colors ."
__label__1 "this dress is great but extremely short . i 'm 5 ' 6 wear a size 4/6 . the 6 looked like a tunic on me it was so short ."
__label__0 "this dress had a nice silhouette but the armholes were cut a bit wide and made it look sloppy- too bad - it would 've made a nice casual dress !"
__label__0 "the shirt design is very nice but it fits very loose . it will not look good if you are heavier as this shirt will make you look wider because of the baggy fit . the sleeves though are fitted and feel a little tight . the material of the sleeves also is very itchy and feels like some wool material ."
__label__-1 "this shirt is beautiful . it is flowy and light a perfect piece for transitioning from winter to spring . however do not follow the washing instructions on the tag . it says you can machine wash tumble dry low and despite going one step further and washing on my gentle cycle in cold water and drying it on extra low it came out of the wash so small that a child could barely wear it . it went from being a tunic to an inappropriate crop top i will never wear again . if you do order please take the"
__label__-1 "this dress is thin and completely see through . it is definitely not worth the price tag . would be really cute in a thicker material ."
__label__-1 "the pattern is very adorable . unfortunately the design is flawed . sizing is great at the waist and hip and the length is spot on but the top is wide . it 's strange because i do n't think it would fit someone that was bustier than me either . will return . i 'm considering buying again on sale and having a tailor correct it ."
__label__-1 "this looked beautiful online but the skirt is n't 100 % silk - the strips of fabric have different fiber content levels with most of them containing some level of polyester . parts of the skirt felt like plastic to touch and one strip has a very prominent gold sheen that looks cheap . overall very disappointing - this is not at all the beautiful silk skirt that it appears to be online . a definite return . i would n't even recommend this at first or second cut ."
__label__-1 "i loved the photo of this dress . upon examination of the dress ( and trying it on ) after receiving in the mail the dress shown online is nothing like the dress i received save for the pattern . the dress i received has a side zip as well as a belt and no pleats on the top . the bottom is also cut straight across not as it appears in the photo . turns out it is not as flattering as it should appear ."
__label__0 "i love this top because it can be worn on or off the shoulders and looks equally as cute either way i bought the red color and it is super cheerful and perfect for summer . looks great with faded jeans . i love the poplin fabric although the stitching quality is shabby and i expect this wo n't hold up long enough to wear again next summer . for the price i feel like it should be crafted a little bit better . i am narrow shoulder 'd and bra size 36 b or c and while a medium might have fit me better o"
__label__-1 "runs big and looked unflattering . i am petite might work on someone taller ."
__label__-1 "i loved these pants . they fit perfectly . and then i washed them . like the other reviewers the pants came out with spots all over them . the color seems to have faded in splotchy patterns . so sad . wondering if retailer will provide store credit or something to make it right ?"
__label__1 "this pants are very comfortable and add a little flare to my typical mom pajama look . i found them true to size ; size small fit my 5 ' 7 135lbs frame . comfortable to sleep and lounge in !"
__label__0 "its just ok. the bodice is fitted and this dress runs tts . it does have a little more poof on the skirt part of the dress than it looks on the model . at this point in my life when i buy a dress i have to say right away i love it and i just did n't . my husband looked and said it is just a blah color on me . so that maybe part of it . the fabric is nice does n't seem inexpensive and the lining is soft and falls nicely underneath the lace . i am 5 ' ( and the dress does fall exactly as it is shown o"
__label__0 "got this on sale in black and red and have only worn the black . quality is poor seems to stretch out over the course of the day and loses its shape somewhat . a smaller size may keep its shape better so you may want to size down . not worth full price ."
__label__1 "at first i thought this sweater might be too boxy but fastened at the waist it 's very flattering and the collar is face-framing and the coral in particular ( really more of a mango sorbet shade ) is unexpected but cheery for winter . but the big selling point is the warmth and the giant pockets . brought a new puppy home just after christmas and this sweater is perfect for layering for late- night trips out with an easy place to stash my phone and treats . bought it in coral and pink ."
__label__0 "this top is a little more casual than i anticipated especially for the price . it is completely sheer and you do need a tank under it . also the arm and neck makes it look more like a ordinary teeshirt . still the lace design is super cute and would work well with both skirts and jeans ."
__label__0 "i tried this on in the store and the colors and fabric are terrific . it 's very light-weight fabric but is n't see-through . the colors are medium in depth not too bright . if you typically wear cool colors and avoid browns you may be able to wear this because the brown is very muted . there 's two strings inside that you tie around your waist to pull the bust of the dress in . i 'm 5 ' 4 and 125 lbs so there 's simply too much fabric in the dress . i would have bought a petite . the tag says it 's avai"
__label__1 "i saw this online but it never struck me as something i would wear . however after seeing it in the store it really caught my eye with its detailing so i tried it on . what a great decision because it is so much more beautiful in person and very soft and warm . it 's a perfect winter sweater to start the new year . i am 5'-7 138 lbs . and the medium fit perfectly though it 's a little shorter on me than shown in the photos ."
__label__0 "i love the way that this suit looked however i found that it was lacking in support . i was disappointed to discover upon trying it on that it just does not cover my butt . it fit elsewhere just fine but the slim cut up the sides left it a little too revealing for my liking . in addition i found the top to be awkwardly fitting around the chest area . i am a 34b and ordered a small and it seemed to be too baggy at the top ."
__label__-1 "i love these pants . bought them in both black and burgundy . but the burgundy pair split in the butt before i even made it to work in the morning . they were n't even tight . so disappointing . i will be returning them ."
__label__-1 "i had been looking at this dress on-line hoping for a pop-back and when i went into my local store today there were two on the rack and one was my size . i found the colors and print a bit blah ( i felt like it could use a little detail for the price ... bead detail or embroidery ) in real life and i did n't love the fabric in my opinion it is a bit too stiff and does n't drape particularly well . things got worse in the dressing room ... it was a disaster on me . i 'm busty and while the top fit because"
__label__-1 "this top fit perfectly but too much of my bra was showing through the black lace . it would be a great top to use as loungewear though ."
__label__0 "i thought i 'd like this dress in the neutral color . i had to return it it as it was quite unflattering . the skirt made my hips look big and the uneven shape did n't help . the top fit well in my usual 4 petite i think it would look nice on some people as it 's something different but i am not one of those it worked on ."
__label__-1 "i think this will work well on very busty hourglass figures or very petite frames ; but on my athletic build this shirt did me no favors . i have one of those body types where my biceps are very muscular and my shoulders are broader than my hips ( w/a 34b chest ) . i typically take a m or a l in most retailer tops and had i kept this i would have gone with the m. -- -- -- -- -- this shirt hit my arm at the low point of my bicep ( ~1 above my elbow ) and made my arms look huge . fyi the v neck is very de"

__label__0 "i 'm usually a petite but bought in regular xs . perhaps a petite would have worked better but this was way too low cut in front and back . i did not like the way it hung on me at all . i 'm 5 ; 2 and 105 lbs but regular xs normally fits better than this did . i could barely keep the shoulders from slipping off . sorry it 's a return for me ."
__label__-1 "this dress is beautiful and extremely well made ... if you can get into it . the only way to close the dress is a line of difficult to button buttons up the back . it 's form fitting so you 'd better be on your yoga a game or have a loved one or hand maiden to lend a hand . i thought about taking it to a tailor to install a hidden side zipper but it 's soooo form fitting i 'm afraid i would n't wear it ."
__label__-1 "i bought this in size xl . it ran much shorter & smaller than is typical for this brand . i found the arms tighter on me compared to the model 's photos . the lace itself was pretty intricate and washed well . i wish this shirt had worked but i ended up donating it after wearing it a couple times . the cropped length and close-fit just did n't work on me . i thought the sleeve shape was pretty . with just a little more material this would have been a favorite . i hope it works well on whoever receives i"
__label__1 "i found this today on the one and only rack . i absolutely fell in love with it . i bought my normal size medium and it fit perfectly . other customers were asking where they could find it in the store . i highly recommend . it can be dressed up or down ."
__label__0 "i love the feel and quality of these pants however they ran super big ! they would not stay up around my waist unfortunately ."
__label__-1 "but it runs super small . i wear a medium for everything but could n't come close to buttoning this . the buttons were about 4 inches apart ( horizontally ) probably should have ordered an extra large in order to fit . the quality and styling seemed great but ordering online requires truth in sizing"
__label__-1 "the cut and color of the dress is awesome . however the biggest flaw is the zipper . i only got to wear this dress once until the zipper broke .. sad day especially at the price . there also were a number of loose threads . i recommend waiting until it goes on sale . you 'll want the extra money for a tailor to fix that zipper ."
__label__-1 "i really wanted to love this dress . i bought it for a photoshoot that will be outdoors and thought that the green color would be perfect . it is well made but the fabric is lighter than expected . the biggest issues was the size . i am 5 ' 7 and typically a size ten . i ordered the ten and it fit like a 14-16. it was huge . if you order this i would say size down two sizes ."
__label__-1 "i was so excited to get this classic-looking retailer dress- i love the ladylike shape and whimsical print . the popsicle print on this dress is really truly adorable . unfortunately the dress is cut really weird and it made me feel like screaming : i bought a size two and it was snug and gaping at the chest ( and i 'm only a 32b ladies so be warned ! ) at the same time the arm holes were huge i mean massively big . i think if you have a swimmer 's body this might work . otherwise you 'll for sure nee"

__label__1 "love the colors ! love the stripes ! great shape ! great style ! but ... i am normally a 12 on top ... and this pulled across my back ... so i have it in for an exchange for a 14. sometimes i have to do that ... i have a broad back . we will see how it fits ! but what an adorable shirt !"
__label__0 "i love this sweater so much and wanted it to be my new favorite but unfortunately it was a bit short for my longer torso . when i raised my arms up it bunched up all wrong because it 's a very thick sweater ."
__label__-1 "this skirt looks/lays exactly like the photo . i bought a size small and i usually wear a size 4. it was maybe a smidge big but nothing that affected the look of the skirt . the material reminded me of felt/wool mixed together almost like sunday school felt cut outs ( but stiffer ) ( not a fan ) .. i was underwhelmed - it looked plain and simple and the color washed me out . definitely not worth the price ( for me anyways ) . good luck !"
__label__1 "i love everything about this top ! the fabric the color the fit ! great top for spring and summer !"
__label__0 "usually i am a huge meadow rue fan but not this time . the print is okay but the shirt seemed stiff and the material was not soft . if the print was just okay but the shirt was super soft or vice versa i would have probably kept the shirt but since it was neither it was returned ?"
__label__-1 "in a sea of dresses this is the one that caught my eye in the whole store . i am a pear shape and ended up trying both the medium and the large taking the medium home . it was super flattering on and was an appropriate length to pair with tights . here 's where the problem happened . i wanted to wear this dress for thanksgiving i put it on and as i tightened the drawstring to cinch in the waist - riiiiiiiiiip ! the drawstring ripped through the fabric at the waistband . so disappointed ."
__label__-1 "i agree with the other reviewer . the colors were fabulous but it was boxy and fit me like a sack . the slits on the side really detracted from the cute fabric and the hood drooped way in the back due to being able to pull away from the slits . it was really a cute idea and i 'm sad it did n't work . i started not to order it based on the first review but i wanted to give it a chance -- i should have listened !"
__label__1 "i love this dress ! i bought the blue one and i love the designs . i recently had a baby so my body is still recovering so finding clothes is a bit difficult but this dress looks awesome and it makes me feel like how i was before i was pregnant ! it flows nicely and is super comfortable ."
__label__0 "i tried this on in the store - i tried regular medium which was way too big except in the chest where it was really tight . the material was a little itchy on me ( but maybe its because the chest was tight ) . the color is lovely ( pink ) . im sure someone will love it but if you are petite i would order the petite and maybe size up if you are busty ."

__label__1 "these are the best trousers i have bought in a long time ! i 'm 5 ' 8 and 145 pounds and the 8 fit with a bit of extra room in the waist -- not enough to size down . i love that they are not skinny -- so over the skinny fit . i plan to wear these with black heels white tee and the vegan black leather jacket i purchased at the same time -- oh and a statement necklace -- always a statement necklace . these are a must for every fall wardrobe ! more pants like these please !"
__label__-1 "i normally wear a medium with these types of fabrics but this one was oddly proportioned on me . the skirt was also not very flattering to my hourglass figure but it at least fit well . the top was baggy and gaped at the armpits as stated by others . i really wanted to like this dress but it made me look 20 pounds heavier even in the places it looked too big on me . i could have tried going with a small but the skirt would have then been too short ."
__label__1 "most casual tops are so sloppy now - not this one ! great cut wish there were more color options ."
__label__1 "loved this dress and was even happier to learn i could order it in petite ! !"
__label__1 "got charlie trousers last year in a different print in my usual size 4 ( 5 ' 2 115 # ) . they initially fit perfectly but stretched out in the thighs and waist and now are loose . this time i bought a size smaller ( size 2 ) . they were snug but i felt them stretch during the first wear and they fit fine now . i recommend sizing down because they stretch out . love the print for summer ( i love anything beachy ) and had to have it ! nice comfortable material which is n't hot for summer . got the regular si"
__label__-1 "i am 5 ' 8 140lbs pear-shaped . i ordered the s and it fit perfectly just skimming the floor . the material is a beautiful gauzy metallic material that is lightweight with a beautiful drape and wonderful sorbet-inspired colors . the waistband is elasticized but not elastic and there is no unflattering poofing which can happen with skirts like this . the flaw however is in the decision to only half-line this skirt with an off-white jersey material . the half-lining is n't horrible but i found it"
__label__1 "normally i am a size 10 or 12 but i sized down to a small . still very swingy and beautiful . i bought the pink and the taupe as well . the colors are beautiful and have great texture to hide stains !"
__label__0 "the fabric was a beautiful color but the material and seams were not well put together . the elastic in the arm was stretched before i tried on the dress so the sleeves did not fit well . i unfortunately ended up returning ."
__label__0 "i found the dot print in the store and though the pattern was cute but when i tried it on i just had to wonder - who actually looks good in this style ? it fits like a sack big and puffy in the middle but tapered at the hem . it creates the exact opposite on an hourglass shape . genuinely puzzled that anyone would look good in this style . to bad i hope they use these cute colors and prints on a style with some waist-definition next time ."
__label__0 "the dress fits true to size and is pretty comfortable . i did look kinda matronly with my 34d chest . it 's a good basic to have on your closet but i ended up returning the one i bought . it did n't feel special enough to keep ."
__label__0 "this top runs very large . i am a size 12/14 & purchased the size l. i could have easily fit in the size m. it 's a pretty top in a comfortable knit fabric but the size was overwhelming so i returned it ."
__label__1 "this top is an amazing go to piece and yes i have all the colors i could grab my hands onto . i will say that under the arms small little balls of fabric begin to appear with wear . therefore it will need a quick once over with your sweater shaver from time to time . good staple for a great price ."
__label__1 "girls this dress is gorgeous . but if you are an a/b cup there is just too much fabric in the bust . the entire dress is pleated from the shoulders down so a curvier figure would be shown to great advantage in this beautiful number . alas i had to send it back and was very sad to do so ."
__label__0 "i love love love these pants ! ! ! they actually fit me and look great ! ! ! ! buyer beware that the dye used is very delicate . i had a very slight stain on them that most likely only i noticed but i decided to use a spray and wash stain remover . the resulting removal of the stain came with a very large loss of color anywhere the stain remover touched . unfortunately this has made these pants unwearable . buy wear and wash these with care ! ! !"
__label__-1 "as others have said this is cropped so will look funny with most pants that are n't high waisted . i 'm going to try it with a few dresses before i return it . the lining is adorable so i do n't want to have to send it back ."
__label__1 "this dress is adorable . it 's very comfortable and so flattering . the only thing is i ca n't understand why it is priced so high . it 's a great dress but i 'm just not convinced it 's the worth the price tag . i 'm going to watch for it to go on sale . fingers crossed !"
__label__1 "color fabric blend and pattern are even more beautiful in person ! unfortunately i wont be keeping this due to length . i am only 5 ' 3 and this top dropped only to about 2 inches below my navel . if you have a short torso or like the short look i would recommend this !"
__label__1 "i just received this dress and i 'm glad i read previous reviews and ordered a size up . i normally wear an xs or s and ordered a medium it fits perfectly . the color is beautiful and the dress is unique . ca n't wait to find a special event to wear it ."
__label__0 "i ordered the dress online and found it to be not as pictured . the length hit several inches above the knee . the sleeves are also 3/4 length rather than full length as pictured . i found the cut to be much less fitted through the torso as well . i tried both the small and xsmall which are my usual sizes . the small was very loose through the torso the xsmall was better but looked overall too short as if it were a petite cut . i am 5 ' 9 however the model is supposed to be 5'10 ."
__label__0 "this is a great feminine top i just wish it were a little bit longer for my taste it hit about two inches below my belly button . it was a little snug around the belly area so that 's why i feel it runs small for the brand usually the brand runs true to size but not for this top"
__label__1 "this is a super flattering cute tank ! i 've purchased it in several colors because it 's such a great fit . somewhat thin material and slightly sheer ( especially the white ) . i like that it has good coverage on the sleeves so that bra straps nor 'side boob/armpit ' fat shows . looks great with pilcro capris for a cute casual summer look ! i wish they would come out with even more colors !"
__label__0 "other reviews are correct . but this has potential to look as good as on the model - structure and quality of the cotton are very flattering . makes legs look miles long . however this fits very tight allows no room for extra tummy hips booty or thighs . i ordered a s ( i 'm usually a 4 ) - was able to get it on ( step into it from the top ) but felt a little self conscious about how tight the fit was . if there was an m would have definitely sized up as i really liked the look ."
__label__0 "i loved the concept of the dress and that is why i chose to keep it in spite of the negatives . the grey color is drab yet leaves room for creativity . it 's stylish yet wrinkles horribly . i am 5 ' 2 so it hangs too low in the front and armpits . another reviewer mentioned the buttons yet there should be one more to bring it up in the chest . the pockets are a great space for hands yet fabric is too thin and they are side slits so will not hold much . i typically wear a 4 petite and the small fits"
__label__0 "i expected better from this top it is thin will snack easy and you have to wear a cami underneath . for the price not worth it . definitely returned !"
__label__0 "i ordered this in the mauve and it 's a really pretty lilac color . unfortunately the fabric is very thin and you can see your bra right through it . my usual size fit great in the shoulders and bust area but goes downhill from there . the top is cut wide under the armpits and just hangs funny in front . based on the model picture i thought this would be a little more form fitting in the front . it 's also very long . completely covers my butt in the back and then some . could of been a beautiful tank"
__label__-1 "i wanted to love this kimono ... it is such a beautiful color and would work well with so many things in my wardrobe but alas it went back due to the strange feel of the fabric ... not a soft touch and because it runs small . i bought the m/l and usually wear a 12/14 but i could n't bring the kimono together in the front ( for a belting option ) ."
__label__-1 "the color is nice and the material is what you might find used by a high school drama club with a low budget - a very cheap polyester . on top of that - it is unhemmed and unfinished in any way - so you can bet that about the second or third wearing there are going to be runs all through the thing . i 've attached a picture of the hem below . on top of that - the ruching is awkward ( as mentioned by another reviewers ) . all in all - kind of terrible ."
__label__-1 "like another reviewer mentioned this shirt is way too short . i 'm only 5 ' 2 ( xs ) and there is no way this top would tuck in like on the model . also the quality is n't great as it 's very thin and there are strings hanging from some of the seams in the front . it 's a shame b/c the print is really pretty and there is this cute little bicycle charm on the tag which makes it feel more unique . sadly it 's going back !"
__label__0 "bought this item on sale and was very disappointed in the quality for the cost . fabric feels cheap like it will snag easily and will stretch out quickly . did not flatter the female form- felt like a burlap sack . gorgeous blue color but not worth the price tag . returned it ."
__label__-1 "i 'm not sure if i only received part of this dress as a mistake but i received the chiffon shell but there was no slip as pictured . it makes it kind of difficult to wear when the entire thing is sheer . i had high hopes but sadly this is being returned . the xs is out of stock now so i ca n't even reorder . bummer ."
__label__1 "excited to get this sweater ! i 'm a 38c and usually wear a size 14 blouse so i ordered an xl as i do n't like clingy sweaters . this was perfect ; fitted but not tight . i 'll be able to wear this with jeans and cute boots for lunches or nice slacks and heels for a dinner date . wish i could 've gotten it for the 25 % off + free s/h but glad i did n't wait - this size was sold out first ."
__label__0 "cute print on both sides but far more cheek was exposed than i anticipated from the photos . the front is n't too skimpy but the back is a bit too small for my taste . definitely narrower in the back than a standard bikini cut . too bad : ( the matching top is my favorite top so i guess i 'll just have to wear black bottoms with it ."
__label__1 "i bought this in both the black motif and the ivory . i got a size 2 and i would say it is true to size . the fabric is very comfortable and does n't wrinkle easily . it does have a flowy look to it but i did n't find that it had too much fabric . i would n't tuck it in though . i find it looks really good with skinny jeans/pants and i love throwing a cardigan over it for cooler days . the details in the double buttons and on the back are really cute and make it more unique . i recommend the shirt ."
__label__0 "i really want to love this dress the style and colors are so nice and easy . i like the loose flowy feel of the dress . it runs a tad large but that is part of the style . what bothers me is that the fabric and embroidery is very stiff and itchy to the point where it is uncomfortable on my arms and body even though it is a loose fitting dress . also it has lining which is nice for modesty but with the stiff/itchy factor mixed with lining it feels a bit cumbersome . i have n't decided if i will k"
__label__1 "this dress is amazing . nice material comfortable and really flattering . slightly tight in the arms but otherwise perfect . highly recommended ! ! !"
__label__1 "ranna designs richly detailed dresses and this is no exception . looks just like the pictures ( colors/cut/drape ) with the exception of a modesty hook at the deep v-neck . sleeves are sheer with an elastic cuff . this dress does not stretch -- the bodice felt very fitted and tight especially at the waist band . runs tts or small ; if you 're busty/broad shouldered size up . it has a dreadful side zip is fully lined and all synthetic fabric ( boo ! ) i purchased size 10p my stats 36c/38-27-35/135 # ."
__label__1 "this dress stunning for the hourglass figure . the hips may be a little narrow . i bought the 6p and 4p and the 4p fit best . i read some reviews that said the hips were snug . it 's true- a little difficult to sit down haha but the dress is so flattering . shoulders are a little loose and i have pretty broad shoulders and a full chest . i 'm 5 ' 4 32dd waist 27 and 130 lbs ."
__label__0 "i bought this top online in the stripes/ivory lace . fits great and is beautiful quality . ( i usually wear small/size 4 in tops and the small was perfect ) . however i found that the ivory lace detail on the bottom sides gave me a saddlebag effect . not good . sadly it 's going back ."
__label__-1 "i could n't wait to get this top in the mail since they did n't have it at my local retailer but i was so disappointed in both the quality and fit . the white is completely see-thru i ca n't believe how sheer the material is - especially for the price . even as the shirt is lying down i can see through both layers of it ... the fit runs small and short ."
__label__-1 "woah these jeans looked ridiculous on me . i felt as though it was 1987 and i was raiding my mom 's closet . the combination of the light wash the crop leg and high waist with the odd stitching around the midsection make this a no . it really accentuates any pouch you may have . i was looking for a high waisted denim but these are very unflattering . i am 5 ' 3 / 140 curvy . no no no !"
__label__-1 "i was so excited to get this robe in the mail but was beyond disappointed when i opened the package . the fabric is extremely stiff and thin . the fabric felt like something curtains would be made out of and the white background was see through . the robe is very short and cut small in the shoulders therefore it looked like i was wearing a piece of children 's clothing . i also ordered the matching pj pants but did n't even take them out of the package after seeing how rough and see through the mater"
__label__1 "this sweatshirt is the perfect solution to chilly mornings or evenings . sundry 's lightweight fleece is never too warm or cool . the fit is true to size . the short sleeves look even cuter rolled up once or twice . i know i will be getting a lot of use from this top once early summer comes along !"
__label__0 "i like this top but unfortunately i will be returning . it 's way too long . the color is pretty as is the design minus the length . it makes it look frumpy . maybe if they offered it in petite or if you 're taller it would work for you ."
__label__0 "beautiful detail and soft sweater . i ordered a medium and the toro so fit well but was short . arms were long and baggy in comparison . given the fit i did n't think the small would work . really wanted this to work but unfortunately it is going back ."
__label__0 "bought this on a whim . i had been wanting a new maxi dress and the bodice looked really cool online . ordered it in black . it fits true to size however the material is a bit on the thin side and where the fabric crosses over on the lower waist line ... it leaves a love handle lump . without the bulk it would be great as overall look is kind of cool . however i am on the fence on this one . for the money there are better maxis out there ."
__label__1 "the pattern is cute and vibrant and the shillouette is simple but the courderoy felt too heavy and stiff and it was too small around the chest for me ( 36dd ) ."
__label__-1 "this skirt is beautiful . fabric is gorgeous with perfect amount of shine and luxury to it . there is a life in this skirt ; it is well made and follows the body lines in a perfect way . or i better say it did fit me perfectly first ten minutes of wearing it . unfortunately it stretched more than a full size and generally lost its shape . now the skirt is two sizes too large and not really wearable anymore ."
__label__1 "love love the print on these but the fit is off . i tried on the solid color in this same style and i took my regular size 30. these i needed a 12. the waist seems really small but the bottom leg parts stretch out and are kind of baggy after 1 wear . i ca n't go down a size because the waist was too small on the 10. since i love the print so much it may be tolerable . rare for hei hei to fit wonky ."
__label__-1 "disappointed the cut of the layer makes anyone wearing it look pregnant . even the model in the picture the way that layer hangs ."
__label__1 "i just got this top and ca n't wait to wear it for spring/summer ! it is a lovely lightweight material and hangs loosely and comfortably . it definitely runs quite large so i would at the very least consider ordering on the small side of what you normally wear if not sizing down one completely . this is coming from someone who usually likes tops on the roomier side so trust me on this ! overall i highly recommend this top if you 're looking for a muted but unique comfy top for the warmer months ahe"
__label__1 "i saw this dress in the store and immediately grabbed it . i think that if i 'd only seen it online i would n't have looked at it twice . in person the fabric is so beautiful a shining and classy velvet crinkle that could go way way dressy with the right accessories . this dress runs large like all of floreat 's items . i am 5 ' 2 110 # and normally wear an xs or 0 but had to size down to xxs petite for the right fit ( like on the model ) . the only drawback is dry clean only . based on the content of th"

__label__-1 "loved the material and the style . unfortunately my fears came true when i received this swimsuit and there was n't enough support despite a review i had read . as a 36d i thought the halter would be enough support however the material is too stretchy to rely on that completely . i am sad i wo n't be keeping this though . the material is heavenly ! ! !"
__label__-1 "this shirt ran small and was more sheer than i expected . had to send it back ."
__label__-1 "i loved the print and fabric of this dress when i first saw it but trying it on was a very different story ! the photo seems to show a wider more well-defined waist with just a small amount of blousing on top but this was not the case . yes the waist fit but it is a narrow band that was covered completely by the hanging over of the ill-fitting top turning the entire look into a shapeless and very unattractive fit . sadly this is going right back !"
__label__0 "really liked this dress but it ran too big for me ."
__label__1 "casual pretty . runs a little large especially through the waist but a great comfortable shirt ."
__label__1 "this t fits perfect and looks great with just about anything . my only concern is the fabric is super light . not enough to be see through but just enough to make me question the quality . i like it and i have worn it a couple of times now with no issues though . the drape is nice and not super revealing ; discreet enough for work . i ordered the white and if it holds up i will certainly order another color because it is very versatile ."
__label__0 "i looked like i was going to work on a farm . well made but seemed fit big . i like and have owned wide leg pants/capris these were cartoonishly wide . needless to say they were returned ."
__label__0 "this top was really cute on someone else but not on me ... on me ti was too big and the color washed me out . the fabric is nice and the pattern and colors are nice too just not on porcelain skin ... like many tops this season it is a bit boxy but looks nice with jeans white shorts or half-tucked into a skirt . i would probably size down a bot ..."
__label__-1 "maybe it 's because i 'm 40 but this top was underwhelming . i felt like it was a cheap tee with a big obnoxious bow on the back . it does look cute on the model so maybe it 's a younger top . i would have felt silly wearing it ."
__label__1 "love the dress but ended up returning it as i 'm not sure how often i would wear it . the only down fall is the dress is straight so you have to take smaller steps but stunning dress ! ! !"
__label__1 "i ordered this last week and received it yesterday and have to say it is a lovely dress . the fabric is light but looks quite rich making one want to touch the textile . the dress pattern reminds me of a missoni . oh the dress is lined . i purchased the blue pattern and am planning on wearing it to work on friday ."
__label__-1 "i 'm 5 ' 2-5 ' 3 which is supposed to be the max height for pieties in retailer ( former employee ) and while the bodice hit right the skirt was insanely long . not even with heels is this gon na be right . and no discount towards hemming ? i 'll wait until this hits the sale rack which it will because concensus is it 's way too long ."
__label__0 "thought i 'd love this top ; i 'm a sucker for lace anything from retailer . but i found the lace while pretty to be quite rough which to me indicates a lower quality . and i guess i should 've known that it would be very swingy ( photos show that ) but it really overwhelmed me . for reference 5 ' 5 125 lbs 34d . sad but this went back ."
__label__1 "like the idea but the tee was was very boxy . i tried the size small and it fit at the shoulders but the body was very big . i would say they pinned it for the product photo : ) i 'm 34a ... usually a size small . it was soft and fun but a no for me at this price ."
__label__0 "nice cut but 6 inches too long and no petite sizes available ."
__label__0 "cute stripes and soft but very pajama top like in feel/look ... like if you wear it out people will assume you 've got the matching bottoms stuck under your pillow at home ."
__label__-1 "the quality of the shirt is top notch . the fabric is lightweight and comfortable . now the cons : this top is cut like a square and fits wide which is not apparent in the photo . definitely not for me ."
__label__-1 "the design and style of shirt is quite cute -- but the mountain pictures is not mont blanc nor does the mountain find itself near chamomix . it is an unmistakable image of the matterhorn and the small town of zermatt is at its base ."
__label__0 "the color and fabric of this item are so appealing and i think this is a great piece for the right person . the fabric is beautiful but also much thicker than i 'd imagined from the photos . it has a quilted quality so does n't drape very well and is just too much fabric for me around the arms . i typically wear a size 12 and ordered the large . i think a medium might have been better . have n't decided yet whether to exchange for m or just plain return . has an artsy cool professor vibe that i like ."
__label__0 "it 's just ok. very thin and feel like it might say and stretch . color is very nice but much thinner and sheer we than what i wanted ."

__label__1 "i love this skirt ! ! it slips seamlessly from day to night and looks great on those of us who happen to be on the taller side . it 's super warm so it 's perfect with tights and boots on those colder winter evenings out ."
__label__1 "i was so excited to see that these were on sale post holidays . love the style and the fit . my only disappointment was that they do n't have as much stretch as i thought they would ( i wrote above that it runs small but if it had more stretch then the sizing would be ok ) . for reference i 'm 5 ' 5 and 10. i usually wear 25 in pilcro pants but these felt tighter . i would exchange for a 26 but they 're sold out unfortunately !"
__label__-1 "c'mon . the accent is wrong ! a simple google search would prevent this ."
__label__1 "i love these shorts . i do n't understand why they are n't sold out yet ! they are buttery soft and fit great . i usually wear a size 26 and these are true to size . they are my go to run around shorts but because they are a dark wash so i feel like i can wear them out with a cute top to dinner even . love ! !"
__label__-1 "so i bought this even after seeing the other reviews . because i love the designer and their things are normally cute and different . this fits just as others describe . it was not flattering to me at all 52. had to go back ."

__label__0 "this is an absolutely beautiful skirt from the front . gives a perfect hourgass shape with the strategic color blocking . however if you have shapely hips and back-side this will definitely emphasize that . had to take it back . a little bit much for work and other formal/professional events . however if you 're less endowed in that area it might work well . gives a great shape !"

__label__0 "this caught my eye and i tried it on the in the store today ( the green ) . i found it to run a little bit large - i expected the small to fit but the xs fit me better ( better fit in armholes and also less billowy ) . i really like the way it looks but ulitimately did not purchase it today . i might reconsider on sale . the flaws ( in my opinion ) are that it is dry clean only the skirt is not lined ( and should be ) and it 's a bit overpriced for the quality . but on the other hand it 's very cute and f"
__label__1 "this is the prettiest little nighty . it is romantic soft and so very pretty . i really adore everything about this piece but the pink detail on the trim along with the floral embroidery is are just the right extra touches that retailer shoppers have come to love ."
__label__-1 "i love the color and style of this dress . and i wanted to love it too ? sadly the fabric is truly inferior to the retailer brand and definitely not worth the price of the dress . checked it out in store and so glad i did as it would have been returned for sure ."
__label__1 "great top lately i 've been sizing down from my usual xs to xxs with pure & good tops but in this one the xs was best . i bought this in 3 colors and they 're my go to tanks for summer . the mint is a bit sheer but not bad . i did not get try the yellow or white one ."
__label__0 "this shirt has a vibrant color and beautiful neck line but unfortunately i had to send it back . it is short waisted with a lot of material in the back . had it been 1-2 inches longer it may flare out but based on the length on me it ended up looking like a shrunken tent . for reference i am 5 ' 8 with a long torso ."
__label__0 "i recommend with reservations . these leggings are 100 % wool soft not itchy light weight lovely knitted pattern . they run large . i sized down to a small . the first time i wore them they were fine . but the second time the waist stretched out and was useless : they were falling down as i walked . such a shame because everything else about them is perfect for cold winter days . they even fit under my silk skirt and would make other lighter garments wearable in winter . so what to do ? at the price th"
__label__0 "i was excited to see this top on sale as i had been watching it for a few weeks . unfortunately i was very disappointed when i received it . it is as a previous person said very much like a pajama top . it is very loose and boxy and in my opinion did not flatter my shape at all . sadly i will be returning it . i would not recommend this top to a person who is athletic or straight and slender as you suggest ."
__label__0 "first off : kudos to the other reviewers for setting the expectation re : the color on these ! they are not a dark rinse at all - not even close . they 're a light-to-medium hue with fading down the front of the thighs . with that in mind i do like the color - especially for spring - but would have been very miffed had i ordered these and they arrived so starkly different from the online photo . -- -- -- -- -- i typically wear a 27-29 depending on the brand and waist rise . these were an online return t"
__label__1 "i saw this vest the week it came in the store . i was hesitant thinking what do i have to go with this ? i left the store and had to go back and purchase it . i 'm so happy i did ! it really does go well simple tops ( dressy or casual ) . it is also perfect for the winter white trend happening this year !"
__label__0 "i was surprised at the high quality of fabric ; however the dress looked like a muumuu on . maybe with a belt it would be cuter ..."
__label__0 "loved the color and looked super cute in the photo but when i got it home it was way too big in chest area waist area & too wide at bottom . i 'm pretty small but i 'm not sure what the right body shape would be for this ."
__label__0 "i read prior reviews and decided to go forward with my purchase . i am so pleased that i did . the m fit nicely . the fabric is not as soft as i had wished . however i think with wear it will become broken in ."
